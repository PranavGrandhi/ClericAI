# ClericAI

Index.html - Webpage where we can enter the question and the link to the logs. Click submit. Wait for the response for the facts which will be displayed in the bottom.

main.py - FAST API backend to serve the requests from the webpage and call gpt4 to fetch the corresponsing facts.

I tests locally by hosting the webpage and the text files locally, setup the API locally and see if I'm getting the responses. Next step is to host the API somewhere so that the validator can use it.
